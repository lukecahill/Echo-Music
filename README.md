# Echo Music

Another music store that I have created. This time in NodeJS!

To run this go to the project root directory, and run 'npm install' this will install the requried packages. 

Once the required packages are installed start the MondoDB 'mongod' process using the --dbpath parameter to specify where your database is located.

Finally run the 'npm start' command which will start the web server, and incoming connections can then be accepted from localhost:3000

Includes a chat function which is created using socket.io.
